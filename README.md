# Mapbox GL Native

[Mapbox GL Native](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native) is a library for embedding interactive, customizable vector maps into native applications on multiple platforms. It takes stylesheets that conform to the [Mapbox Style Specification](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-style-spec/), applies them to vector tiles that conform to the [Mapbox Vector Tile Specification](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec), and renders them using OpenGL. [Mapbox GL JS](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js) is the WebGL-based counterpart, designed for use on the Web.

This repository uses Mapbox GL Native to generate static maps of the world.
